# What the CPS?

## Lesson Learned
### PII Masking
I am working with personal account data and wanted to share my work wihtout exposing PII. I used a hidden file to store sensitive information and manually block out sensitive data in image files. I also set up my notebooks so that the full text of extracted text would never be returned, only the parsed, non-PII data.

### Error Handling
There were only certain months that had peak charge information and when I tried parsing the bills outside of those months, without peak charges, I kept getting errors. This was a perfect use case for incorporating exception handling in my scripts using the `try` . . .  `except` syntax. This was, if a bill didn't have peak data, the value would be 0.

<details><summary>Expanded Definitions<br>
(denoted by *asterisk above)</summary>

>****Service Availability Charge***<br>
This is a fixed monthly charge to recover billing and metering. Billing costs include the paper the bill is printed on, the envelope and mailing costs. Metering covers the physical meter, transmission lines and poles, down to screws and bolts. Prior to the rate increase, this charge was $8.75.

>****Peak Consumption***<br>
Applies during the months of June through September when an additional charge is applied for every kilowatt hour (kWh) used in excess of 600 kWh. The Peak Capacity Charge covers the higher costs for electricity CPS Energy incurs during summer months when demand for electricity is at its highest. CPS Energy says this charge is to encourage customers to conserve during months when energy demand is highest. 

>****Fuel Adjustment***<br>
This rate fluctuates monthly based on the prices CPS Energy pays for fuel. When the market price of natural gas is high, this charge goes up. ***Customers also pay about $0.00087 per kilowatt hour toward the Winter Storm Uri recovery costs.***

>****Regulatory Adjustment***<br>
 As part of ERCOT, CPS Energy is able to buy additional power from the market as needed and to sell excess power into the market. ERCOT is responsible for managing the statewide electric grid, and as such charges a mandatory fee to recover its administrative costs for managing the grid.
