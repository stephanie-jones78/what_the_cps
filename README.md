> ## Expanded Definitions
(denoted by *asterisk above)

>****Service Availability Charge***<br>
This is a fixed monthly charge to recover billing and metering. Billing costs include the paper the bill is printed on, the envelope and mailing costs. Metering covers the physical meter, transmission lines and poles, down to screws and bolts. Prior to the rate increase, this charge was $8.75.

>****Peak Consumption***<br>
Applies during the months of June through September when an additional charge is applied for every kilowatt hour (kWh) used in excess of 600 kWh. The Peak Capacity Charge covers the higher costs for electricity CPS Energy incurs during summer months when demand for electricity is at its highest. CPS Energy says this charge is to encourage customers to conserve during months when energy demand is highest. 

>****Fuel Adjustment***<br>
This rate fluctuates monthly based on the prices CPS Energy pays for fuel. When the market price of natural gas is high, this charge goes up. ***Customers also pay about $0.00087 per kilowatt hour toward the Winter Storm Uri recovery costs.***

>****Regulatory Adjustment***<br>
 As part of ERCOT, CPS Energy is able to buy additional power from the market as needed and to sell excess power into the market. ERCOT is responsible for managing the statewide electric grid, and as such charges a mandatory fee to recover its administrative costs for managing the grid.
